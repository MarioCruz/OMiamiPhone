# PhoneHack — Banana Poem Phone

An interactive art installation for the [O'Miami Poetry Festival](https://www.omiami.org/). Dial a number on a real phone keypad, hear ringing, then listen to a poem through the earpiece. Every number leads to a poem — but some numbers hide surprises.

Created by **Mario The Maker**.

Built with a Raspberry Pi Pico, DFPlayer Mini MP3 module, and a salvaged phone handset.

## How It Works

1. Lift the handset — hear a dial tone
2. Dial a 7-digit number — hear DTMF touch tones
3. If the number is in the phonebook — hear ringing, then the mapped poem plays
4. If not — hear ringing, then a random O'Miami poem plays
5. Hang up at any time to reset

## Easter Eggs

| Dial | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **867-5309** | Jenny Munaweera's poem (Tommy Tutone!) |
| **305-867-5309** | Same — area code gets stripped |
| **555-2368** | "Who are you going to call?... A poet?" (Ghostbusters) |
| **411** | Directory assistance — explains the phone and hints at Easter eggs |
| **305** | O'Miami shoutout |
| **0** | Operator |
| **211** | Community services — "In this city of sun and salt..." |
| **511** | Traffic — "Every road in Miami leads to the ocean..." |
| **611** | Customer service — "All representatives are busy reading poetry..." |
| **711** | Telecom relay — "Every voice deserves to be heard..." |
| **811** | Utility locator — "Beneath every sidewalk, a tangle of roots and wires..." |
| **911** | Emergency redirect — "This is not a real phone" |
| **311** | City services |

All other numbers play a random poem from the 28-poem O'Miami collection.

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) — MicroPython
- 3x4 membrane phone keypad
- DFPlayer Mini MP3 module (YX5200) — UART, built-in amp
- microSD card (FAT32, ≤32GB) — stores all audio
- Phone handset with 8-ohm earpiece
- Hook switch (normally-open, on this handset)
- 1K resistor (Pico TX → DFPlayer RX)
- DFPlayer BUSY pin → Pico GP17 (end-of-track detection)

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for full wiring diagrams and BOM.

## State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> IDLE
    IDLE --> OFF_HOOK : Lift handset
    OFF_HOOK --> DIALING : First digit
    OFF_HOOK --> IDLE : Hang up
    OFF_HOOK --> IDLE : 30s timeout
    DIALING --> CONNECTING : 7 digits + 2s wait
    DIALING --> CONNECTING : 10 digits
    DIALING --> OFF_HOOK : Special code played
    DIALING --> OFF_HOOK : * clear
    DIALING --> IDLE : Hang up
    CONNECTING --> PLAYING : Number found
    CONNECTING --> PLAYING : Random poem
    CONNECTING --> IDLE : Hang up
    PLAYING --> OFF_HOOK : Playback finished (BUSY pin)
    PLAYING --> OFF_HOOK : Key press interrupt

```

## Dialing Logic

- **7 digits** (xxx-xxxx): waits 2 seconds, then looks up in phonebook
- **10 digits** (xxx-xxx-xxxx): strips area code, looks up last 7
- **Special codes** (3-digit) trigger after 1 second pause:
  - `0` — Operator
  - `211` — Community services
  - `305` — O'Miami!
  - `311` — City services
  - `411` — Directory assistance
  - `511` — Traffic/road conditions
  - `611` — Customer service
  - `711` — Telecommunications relay
  - `811` — Call before you dig
  - `911` — Emergency redirect
- Numbers cannot start with `0` (except operator)
- `*` clears input, `#` is ignored during dialing

## SD Card Layout

The `sd_card/` directory in this repo is the complete SD card image. It is tracked in git so the phone can be fully recreated if the card is lost.

DFPlayer reads the 3-digit prefix and ignores the rest. The suffix is for humans.

Update `RANDOM_COUNT` in `config.py` if you add or remove poems from `/03/`.

After copying to SD card on macOS: `dot_clean /Volumes/<SDCard>`

## Audio Generation

All voice messages are generated with **ElevenLabs TTS** (Sarah voice, `eleven_multilingual_v2` model). The O'Miami poems use multiple voices matched by poem type and poet gender.

Dial tones and DTMF are synthesized with `tools/generate_tones.py`.

To regenerate the 411 directory listing:
```bash
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
python tools/generate_411.py
```

## Deploying to Pico

```bash
mpremote connect /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 cp config.py :config.py + cp phonebook.json :phonebook.json + cp poetry_phone.py :main.py + cp dfplayer.py :dfplayer.py
```

To run without rebooting:
```bash
mpremote connect /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 run poetry_phone.py
```

## Testing Without Hardware

Both the DFPlayer and hook switch are optional. Set in `config.py`:
```python
HOOK_ENABLED = False    # Skip hook switch (always acts off-hook)
AUDIO_ENABLED = False   # Skip DFPlayer (prints debug to console)
```

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest test/ -v
```

145 tests across 5 test files. Mock framework in `test/mock_micropython.py` uses AST parser to avoid MicroPython imports.
